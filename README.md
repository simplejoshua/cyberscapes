# Cyberscapes by EndoGames
The final build for Cyberscapes, a digital game-based learning tool that aims to enhance the cybersecurity literacy and interest among the general Filipino public and aspiring cybersecurity professionals. 

This project was developed by Joshua Lloyd Doros and Christian Dale Encinares, under the supervision of Prof. Susan Pancho-Festin, as part of the Department of Computer Science's Computer Security Group at the University of the Philippines Diliman.

## Directory Structure
The root of the repository includes the windows and web builds of the game, specifically **Cyberscapes_Windows.zip** and **Cyberscapes_WebGL.zip**, along with the option to run the game on the android platform by downloading **Cyberscapes_Android.apk**. Alternatively, the game could be access through [itch.io](https://simplejoshua.itch.io/cyberscapes).

The English and Filipino versions of the survey forms used during the playtesting can be found under the **Survey Forms** folder in the root. 

Within the root directory, there is a folder named **Data Analysis** that includes the file **Cyberscapes_StatAnalysis.ipynb**, which contains the code utilized for the statistical analysis of the survey responses.
